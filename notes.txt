should i use helm? are there any other tools that will be more efficient?


how to create helm chart?
-helm repo? https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/
-if possible with github, can be on same project repo or create repo just for helm?
	* github pages? https://pages.github.com/


TODOs:
	yaml to create namespaces (cicd, database, dev/stage/prod)
		* check how to integrate vars from helm chart to the yaml files
